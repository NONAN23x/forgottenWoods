# Shadowing Nightfall
-- -

Welcome to the repository of my recent game/ mini project, Shadowing Nightfall.
Shadowing Nightfall is a 3D-FPS Oriented Horror Action Survival Game made using UnityEngine.
This repository contains all the code I've written to handle the game's logic, this doesn't include the Character's Attributes such as FPS function, Shooting and Weapon Mechanics, Since that was achieved by using FPS Engine under Unity Engine.

- Note that this repo isnt enough by itself to compile the game from source and achieve the product, this is just a scripts folder of my project, the other important things like the Land Data, Assets like Rocks, grass, trees and buildings, arent included here, As I dont plan to make then open source and some of them are freely available assets.
